# Welcome to my Cool Repo! ðŸ¤“

Hey y'all, this is where I keep all my notebooks and scripts for some sweet computer vision and audio processing tasks. Check it out, here's what we've got in here:

- `Imagesegmentation_detectionlevel_pixel_de_DETR_panoptic_and_others.ipynb`: I made this one with Colaboratory, it's got some rad image segmentation and detection code using DETR and panoptic segmentation and other models.
- `SAHI_and_Detectron2.ipynb`: Another Colaboratory masterpiece, this time we got object detection using SAHI and Detectron2 libraries.
- `SAHI_inference_for_yolov5.ipynb`: Colaboratory strikes again! This one's got code for object detection using SAHI and YOLOv5 models.
- `TrainNewConceptImageDetection_OTHER_Detectron2_Tutorial.ipynb`: More Colaboratory goodness, with code for training new concepts for image detection using the Detectron2 library.
- `diarization_whisper_and_pyannote_transcripts_with_speaker_names.ipynb`: Here's one I made with Colaboratory for audio diarization and generating transcripts with speaker names. Cool, huh?
- `wav2vec2_transcript_HuggingFace.ipynb`: And finally, a Colaboratory notebook for audio transcription using HuggingFace's wav2vec2 model.

So there you have it, folks! All the notebooks are made with Colaboratory and might need some extra stuff to run, but just check the docs and you should be good to go. ðŸ¤“
